the group of medicines called cns stimulants. it is used to manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies. primary apnea in premature babies happens due to immature development of baby’s breathing centers. capnea injection has been shown to reduce the number of episodes of interrupted breathing in premature newborns babies. it can also be used to manage bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) among premature babies. before capnea injection is administered, inform your doctor if you child has any liver, kidney or heart problems. you must also inform your doctor if your child suffers from seizure disorders, slow weight gain or frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) as a precaution. if you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. the most common side effect of capnea injection is fast or irregular heart rate. consult your doctor if it worsens.  uses of capnea injection manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies manage and manages bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) in premature babies   how capnea injection workscapnea injection is a cns stimulant. it works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. as a result, the brain transfers a lot of breathing signals to the lungs which makes the lungs breathe more deeper and faster. it also increases the number of breathing cycles, manages the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.  directions for usecapnea injection will be administered by a doctor or a nurse into the vein of the child (intravenous drips). your doctor will decide the correct dose and duration of therapy for your child based on their gestational age, body weight and health condition.  side effects of capnea injectioncommon fast or irregular heart rate increased blood sugar levels  contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects in your child after capnea injection is administered:  severe bloody stools fits blood infections (sepsis) allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching, redness, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or threating and breathing difficulties)     warning & precautionsbreastfeedingcontraindicatedif you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. kidneyuse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with kidney problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. liveruse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with liver problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. allergycontraindicatedif your child is allergic to caffeine, kindly inform your doctor before capnea injection is administered to the child. heart diseaseuse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with heart problems (such as irregular heart rate). therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. use in pediatricssafecapnea injection can be used in premature infants born between 28-33 gestation weeks (7-8 months of pregnancy) under careful medical supervision. othersbefore capnea injection is administered to the baby, kindly inform the doctor if your baby suffers from any of the following conditions:  fits frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) increased urination slow or reduced weight gain or food intake increased caffeine intake by the mother before the baby is delivered use of antiepileptic medicines by the mother during her pregnancy     interactionsa. drug-drug interactions: before capnea injection is administered to the child, kindly inform the doctor if your child is given any of the following medicines as a precaution:  other medicines that help in breathing (ex. theophylline, doxapram) medicines used to control fits (such as phenobarbitone or phenytoin) taken by the mother during pregnancy before delivering the baby ketoconazole (a medicine used to manage fungal infections) medicines used to manage stomach ulcers (such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, etc.)  overdosage: capnea injection will be administered only by a doctor or a nurse in a hospital, and so it is unlikely to receive an overdose. however, consult your doctor if you notice fits or any other side effects in your child.  synopsis   drug :   caffeine   pharmacological category :   methylxanthines   therapeutic

Introduction about capnea solutioncapnea solution contains caffeine which belongs to the group of medicines called cns stimulants. it is used to manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies. primary apnea in premature babies happens due to immature development of baby’s breathing centers. capnea solution has been shown to reduce the number of episodes of interrupted breathing in premature newborns babies. it can also be used to manage bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) among premature babies. before capnea solution is administered, inform your doctor if you child has any liver, kidney or heart problems. you must also inform your doctor if your child suffers from seizure disorders, slow weight gain or frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) as a precaution. if you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. the most common side effect of capnea solution is fast or irregular heart rate. consult your doctor if it worsens.  uses of capnea solution manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies manage and manages bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) in premature babies   how capnea solution workscapnea solution is a cns stimulant. it works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. as a result, the brain transfers a lot of breathing signals to the lungs which makes the lungs breathe more deeper and faster. it also increases the number of breathing cycles, manages the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.  directions for usecapnea solution will be administered orally (via gastric feeding tube) to your child only by a doctor or a nurse. your doctor will decide the correct dose and duration of therapy for your child based on their gestational age, body weight and health condition.  side effects of capnea solutioncommon fast or irregular heart rate increased blood sugar levels  contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects in your child after capnea solution is administered:  severe bloody stools fits blood infections (sepsis) allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching, redness, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or threating and breathing difficulties)     warning & precautionsbreastfeedingcontraindicatedif you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. kidneyuse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with kidney problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. liveruse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with liver problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. allergycontraindicatedif your child is allergic to caffeine, kindly inform your doctor before capnea solution is administered to the child. heart diseaseuse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with heart problems (such as irregular heart rate). therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. use in pediatricssafecapnea solution can be used in premature infants born between 28-33 gestation weeks (7-8 months of pregnancy) under careful medical supervision. othersbefore capnea solution is administered to the baby, kindly inform the doctor if your baby suffers from any of the following conditions:  fits frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) increased urination slow or reduced weight gain or food intake increased caffeine intake by the mother before the baby is delivered use of antiepileptic medicines by the mother during her pregnancy     interactionsa. drug-drug interactions: before capnea solution is administered to the child, kindly inform the doctor if your child is given any of the following medicines as a precaution:  other medicines that help in breathing (ex. theophylline, doxapram) medicines used to control fits (such as phenobarbitone or phenytoin) taken by the mother during pregnancy before delivering the baby ketoconazole (a medicine used to manage fungal infections) medicines used to manage stomach ulcers (such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, etc.)  overdosage: capnea solution will be administered only by a doctor or a nurse in a hospital, and so it is unlikely to receive an overdose. however, consult your doctor if you notice fits or any other side effects in your child.  synopsis

                      Introductioncognistar 30mg contains cerebroprotein hydrolysate which belongs to the group of medicines called neurotrophic agents. it is used to manage cranial injury (trauma to scalp, skull, and/or brain), inability to sustain concentration in dementia (group of disease or illness that affects your ability to think, memorize and reason), cerebrovascular disease that includes stroke (brain damage due to interruption of blood flow), and alzheimer's disease (progressive neurologic disorder that causes brain to shrink and brain cells to die). cerebroprotein hydrolysate is a neurotrophic agent which works by protecting the nerve cells from toxins and lack of oxygen thus improving its survival rate. it also helps in the formation of new nerve cells by increasing nutrition supply to the brain cells and reducing the inflammatory reaction of the brain tissues which results in preventing damage to the brain cells. cognistar 30mg is not recommended for use in patients with severe kidney dysfunction, status epilepticus (life threatening neurological disorder), and or major epilepsia (seizure that causes loss of consciousness). it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (fits or seizures) and or allergic diathesis (condition that causes group of allergic reaction such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, or atopic dermatitis). cognistar 30mg should be used with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women only if it is clearly advised by your doctor. it should be used with caution in elderly patients (above 65 years). consult your doctor before receiving. the common side effects associated with the use of cognistar 30mg are headache, nausea, vertigo (sensation of spinning), increased sweating, agitation, fever, and hallucinations. inform your doctor if any of the symptom worsens.  uses of cognistar 30mgit is used to manage:  cranial injury (head injury) cerebrovascular disease that includes stroke (lack of blood

dementia is a group of symptoms such as loss of memory and thinking/reasoning abilities. alzheimer’s disease is a disorder that causes progressive degeneration of brain cells, resulting in brain shrinkage. it is characterised by dementia, social withdrawal, and wandering. cognistar 60mg injection is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal dysfunction, status epilepticus (a life-threatening neurological disorder), or major epilepsia (a seizure that causes loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions). cognistar 60mg injection should be used with caution in

the group of medicines called cns stimulants. it is used to manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies. primary apnea in premature babies happens due to immature development of baby’s breathing centers. capnea injection has been shown to reduce the number of episodes of interrupted breathing in premature newborns babies. it can also be used to manage bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) among premature babies. before capnea injection is administered, inform your doctor if you child has any liver, kidney or heart problems. you must also inform your doctor if your child suffers from seizure disorders, slow weight gain or frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) as a precaution. if you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. the most common side effect of capnea injection is fast or irregular heart rate. consult your doctor if it worsens.  uses of capnea injection manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies manage and manages bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) in premature babies   how capnea injection workscapnea injection is a cns stimulant. it works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. as a result, the brain transfers a lot of breathing signals to the lungs which makes the lungs breathe more deeper and faster. it also increases the number of breathing cycles, manages the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.  directions for usecapnea injection will be administered by a doctor or a nurse into the vein of the child (intravenous drips). your doctor will decide the correct dose and duration of therapy for your child based on their gestational age, body weight and health condition.  side effects of capnea injectioncommon fast or irregular heart rate increased blood sugar levels  contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects in your child after capnea injection is administered:  severe bloody stools fits blood infections (sepsis) allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching, redness, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or threating and breathing difficulties)     warning & precautionsbreastfeedingcontraindicatedif you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. kidneyuse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with kidney problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. liveruse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with liver problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. allergycontraindicatedif your child is allergic to caffeine, kindly inform your doctor before capnea injection is administered to the child. heart diseaseuse with cautioncapnea injection should be used with caution in babies with heart problems (such as irregular heart rate). therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. use in pediatricssafecapnea injection can be used in premature infants born between 28-33 gestation weeks (7-8 months of pregnancy) under careful medical supervision. othersbefore capnea injection is administered to the baby, kindly inform the doctor if your baby suffers from any of the following conditions:  fits frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) increased urination slow or reduced weight gain or food intake increased caffeine intake by the mother before the baby is delivered use of antiepileptic medicines by the mother during her pregnancy     interactionsa. drug-drug interactions: before capnea injection is administered to the child, kindly inform the doctor if your child is given any of the following medicines as a precaution:  other medicines that help in breathing (ex. theophylline, doxapram) medicines used to control fits (such as phenobarbitone or phenytoin) taken by the mother during pregnancy before delivering the baby ketoconazole (a medicine used to manage fungal infections) medicines used to manage stomach ulcers (such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, etc.)  overdosage: capnea injection will be administered only by a doctor or a nurse in a hospital, and so it is unlikely to receive an overdose. however, consult your doctor if you notice fits or any other side effects in your child.  synopsis   drug :   caffeine   pharmacological category :   methylxanthines   therapeutic

Introduction about capnea solutioncapnea solution contains caffeine which belongs to the group of medicines called cns stimulants. it is used to manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies. primary apnea in premature babies happens due to immature development of baby’s breathing centers. capnea solution has been shown to reduce the number of episodes of interrupted breathing in premature newborns babies. it can also be used to manage bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) among premature babies. before capnea solution is administered, inform your doctor if you child has any liver, kidney or heart problems. you must also inform your doctor if your child suffers from seizure disorders, slow weight gain or frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) as a precaution. if you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. the most common side effect of capnea solution is fast or irregular heart rate. consult your doctor if it worsens.  uses of capnea solution manage primary apnea (episodes of interrupted breathing) in premature babies manage and manages bronchopulmonary dysplasia (airway damage) in premature babies   how capnea solution workscapnea solution is a cns stimulant. it works by stimulating a part of the brain that controls breathing. as a result, the brain transfers a lot of breathing signals to the lungs which makes the lungs breathe more deeper and faster. it also increases the number of breathing cycles, manages the airway damage and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.  directions for usecapnea solution will be administered orally (via gastric feeding tube) to your child only by a doctor or a nurse. your doctor will decide the correct dose and duration of therapy for your child based on their gestational age, body weight and health condition.  side effects of capnea solutioncommon fast or irregular heart rate increased blood sugar levels  contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects in your child after capnea solution is administered:  severe bloody stools fits blood infections (sepsis) allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching, redness, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or threating and breathing difficulties)     warning & precautionsbreastfeedingcontraindicatedif you are the mother of the premature infant who receives the management, you must not drink coffee or take foods which has high caffeine content. this is because the caffeine taken by the breastfeeding mother may pass through the breast milk to the nursing premature infant who is already receiving caffeine therapy and may lead to an overdosage. kidneyuse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with kidney problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. liveruse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with liver problems. therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. allergycontraindicatedif your child is allergic to caffeine, kindly inform your doctor before capnea solution is administered to the child. heart diseaseuse with cautioncapnea solution should be used with caution in babies with heart problems (such as irregular heart rate). therefore, inform your doctor as a precaution. use in pediatricssafecapnea solution can be used in premature infants born between 28-33 gestation weeks (7-8 months of pregnancy) under careful medical supervision. othersbefore capnea solution is administered to the baby, kindly inform the doctor if your baby suffers from any of the following conditions:  fits frequent regurgitation (spitting up of milk or food) increased urination slow or reduced weight gain or food intake increased caffeine intake by the mother before the baby is delivered use of antiepileptic medicines by the mother during her pregnancy     interactionsa. drug-drug interactions: before capnea solution is administered to the child, kindly inform the doctor if your child is given any of the following medicines as a precaution:  other medicines that help in breathing (ex. theophylline, doxapram) medicines used to control fits (such as phenobarbitone or phenytoin) taken by the mother during pregnancy before delivering the baby ketoconazole (a medicine used to manage fungal infections) medicines used to manage stomach ulcers (such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, etc.)  overdosage: capnea solution will be administered only by a doctor or a nurse in a hospital, and so it is unlikely to receive an overdose. however, consult your doctor if you notice fits or any other side effects in your child.  synopsis

                      Introductioncognistar 30mg contains cerebroprotein hydrolysate which belongs to the group of medicines called neurotrophic agents. it is used to manage cranial injury (trauma to scalp, skull, and/or brain), inability to sustain concentration in dementia (group of disease or illness that affects your ability to think, memorize and reason), cerebrovascular disease that includes stroke (brain damage due to interruption of blood flow), and alzheimer's disease (progressive neurologic disorder that causes brain to shrink and brain cells to die). cerebroprotein hydrolysate is a neurotrophic agent which works by protecting the nerve cells from toxins and lack of oxygen thus improving its survival rate. it also helps in the formation of new nerve cells by increasing nutrition supply to the brain cells and reducing the inflammatory reaction of the brain tissues which results in preventing damage to the brain cells. cognistar 30mg is not recommended for use in patients with severe kidney dysfunction, status epilepticus (life threatening neurological disorder), and or major epilepsia (seizure that causes loss of consciousness). it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (fits or seizures) and or allergic diathesis (condition that causes group of allergic reaction such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, or atopic dermatitis). cognistar
